                        <h2>Welcome To Duta Bina Bhuana Foundation</h2>
                        <p>The Duta Bina Bhuana (DBB) Foundation was founded by 3 academics: Dr. Jonathan Mulia, Prof. Ir. I Made Sukadana and Ir. Priyadi Reksasiswaya, MBA, in 1997.
                            The DBB Foundation has focused on Education, Social Empowerment, and Community Empowerment since its beginnings.</p>
                        <p>The three founders of the DBB Foundation mission is to provide access to education and skills training for Balinese people so that they might have a brighter future.
                            Their motto, "Educate and Empower via formal and vocational Education"</p>
                        <p>In 2015, the DBB Foundation made a commitment toward early childhood education by founding the Duta Bina Bhuana School (DBB School), that encompasses three
                            languages as the foundation for leaming: Indonesian, English, and Mandarin. The Early Childhood Education (PAUD) which includes Playgroups, Kindergarten, and the Elementary School, is part of DBB Educational structure</p>
                        <p>In addition to the DBB Schools, the DBB Foundation also operates a Vocational Education program known as the Bali OSEC Program, which prepares working-age people for employment in Indonesia and overseas. Bali OSEC was established on 7 April,2010, with three main programs: Computer Course, English Course and Professional Balinese Dance</p>
                        <p>Besides that, the DBB Foundation took the initiative in 2021 to launch The People's Law Centre (PLC). a Legal Aid Center for the community, including Indonesian nationals and foreigners in Indonesia, particularly in the Province of Bali. In addition, the DBB Foundation will be spearheading a program called "Srikandi Justice Campaign" in Bali, to create awareness for domestic violence, particularly among Balinese and other local Indonesians. It is important to also understand how the COVID pandemic has amplified the problem of domestic violence. Loss of employment causes increased time spent at home in addition to the financial stress due to the loss of income</p>
                        <p>The PLC also recognizes the need of participating in legal education and assisting persons who are facing legal issues. It also strives to establish a peaceful and secure environment for all Bali residents. Only by giving objective and clear legal information can this be accomplished, resulting in fewer individuals becoming victims of fraudsters and scammers</p>
